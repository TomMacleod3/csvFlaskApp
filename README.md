# csvFlaskApp
This app is a small part of my unversity project developing an automated system for my company.
I cannot add the wider project that this small piece of code is apart of due to commercial sensitivity.
The app aims to take large excel files 'clean' them so they can be stored in a MySQL database.
From there the Statistics stored in these files are reproduced in Grafana, 
the visualisations created allow for a better view of the business situation than the previous way of manually reporting data.
